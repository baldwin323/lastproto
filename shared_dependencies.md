The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. Django Framework: All the files are built using the Django framework, which provides the structure and components necessary for building the web application.

2. Project Name: The project name "my_project" is shared across all files as it is the root directory of the Django project.

3. App Name: The app name "app" is shared across several files as it is the name of the Django application within the project.

4. Settings: The settings.py file contains the configuration for the Django project, which is shared across all other files in the project.

5. URLs: The urls.py files (in both the project and app directories) define the URL routing for the project and the app respectively. These URLs are shared across the views and potentially other files that need to reference these routes.

6. Models: The models.py file defines the data schema for the app, which is shared across the views, admin, and potentially other files that need to interact with the database.

7. Views: The views.py file contains the logic for handling requests and responses. These views are shared across the urls.py files and potentially other files that need to reference these views.

8. Admin: The admin.py file is used to define the admin interface for the app. The models defined in models.py are shared here.

9. WSGI: The wsgi.py file contains the WSGI application for the Django project, which is shared across any files that need to interact with the WSGI server.

10. Database: The PostgreSQL database is shared across all files that need to interact with the database, such as models.py and potentially views.py.

11. Migrations: The migrations directory and its __init__.py file are used by Django to manage database schema migrations. The models defined in models.py are shared here.

12. Apps: The apps.py file is used to configure the Django app. The app name "app" is shared here.

13. Tests: The tests.py file is used to write tests for the app. The models and views defined in models.py and views.py respectively are shared here.
